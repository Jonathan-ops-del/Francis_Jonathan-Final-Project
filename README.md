This is the first phase of my Personal Portfolio Project built during my time in the York University Web Development Program. There are two folders in this project one for the Frontend & one for the Backend. The Frontend of the project is built from React, and the Backend is built from Node.js Express. We are using an array in this phase instead of an SQL or noSQL database. Once the Application is running you can view my personal portfolio. You can also create an entry , a user account, and can login once you are an user to view all entries made by users and non-users.

To Get Started :

1) You will need to clone this project into your preferred Code Editor.
2) In your Code Editor you will need to open up two terminals. One Terminal will be used to work the Frontend , and second for the Backend.

3) Starting the Backend.
4) Make sure to create .env file for the Backend portion of the project, you can use port 4001 , see .env.example file to copy into your own .env file
5) Do not use port 3000, this will be used by the Frontend.
6) You can now install the dependencies , run "npm install" in the terminal.
7) Once installed you can run "npm start" in the terminal dedicated to the backend.

8) Starting the Frontend.
9) Open up the second terminal, and run "npm install" to install the dependencies for the Frontend.
10) Run "npm start" to have your React frontend running on http://localhost:3000/
